# PHP CRUD Bookstore

Combining PHP and JavaScript for a CRUD bookstore.

To make it easier for others to try this project, I decided to do away with the MySQL part and replaced it with a simple  `json` data structure. 

## Install

Once you have cloned or downloaded the repository, copy the contents of the `src` folder to your PHP server and open the `index-js.html` file in your browser via `localhost`.
